I’m in the process of reinventing myself—from a professor at the University of Hawaii to a purveyor of intelligent entertainment. I have a plan.

You can check out my academic background on Professional page, Experience page, and Research and Publications page. I wrote as an academic with a necessarily turgid style, yet always hoped that general readers would find their way to Libricide: The Regime-Sponsored Destruction of Books and Libraries in the 20th Century and book two, Burning Books and Leveling Libraries: Extremist Violence and Cultural Destruction. You can find out about them on the research and publications page.

In September 2014, I put into play a two year RETIREMENT PLAN in which I would learn to write in a different way, reach more people, and make facts come alive. The plan involved MOVING TO LONDON and immersion in its stimulating atmosphere. I fell on London as if starved and perhaps I was.

For some of the events and activities I’ve been engaged in, see Lectures Attended, and Activities and Organization page.

Knowing that I needed to deliver facts differently, I enrolled in a nine-month Westminster University GUIDING COURSE (2014-2015) and learned to structure and deliver street walks. Guiding involves alchemy, a mixture of storytelling and historical research. If you are interested in the course, look at my Guiding Course page.

Meanwhile I have been travelling the globe as a SPECIAL TOPICS LECTURER on luxury liners. My power point presentations emphasize cultural preservation and destruction, cultural history, and biography. You can read about them on Cruise Ship lectures page.
But the pillar of the plan, to move from academic to popular writing, has been a two-year PROGRAM IN CREATIVE NONFICTION at City University, London.  Creative nonfiction is the use of literary techniques to present facts in a compelling and vivid manner, with dollops of storytelling. Instead of a thesis, students write a publishable book. I have almost completed mine, Cover Stories: Writers from Austen to Woolf Wrestle with Womanhood and Censorship.
