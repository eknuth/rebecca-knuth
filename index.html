  <h2>Rebecca Knuth</h2>
  <h4>Aloha and welcome!</h4>

  <p>I am a Full Professor in the Library and Information Science Program, which is part of the Information and Computer Sciences Department at the University of Hawaii.</p>

  <p>My research is focused on international, interdisciplinary and comparative inquiry into censorship, intellectual freedom (access to information as a human right), international librarianship, literacy, the history of books and libraries, nationalism, book burning, genocide, and the link between extremism and cultural destruction.</p>
  <p>For information about my lastest book, <em>Children's Literature and British Identity: Imagining a People and a Nation</em>, please refer to the<a href="publications.html">publications page</a>.</p>
  <p>You can also find information about my other books, <em>Libricide: The Regime-Sponsored Destruction of Books and Libraries in the 20th Century</em> and <em>Burning Books and Leveling Libraries: Extremist Violence and Cultural Destruction</em>, in the same location.</p>
